Melodee's love of design and print started at 15 East Lancaster Avenue, Paoli, when her father opened CDQ Printing when she was 13 years old. While working for her father, she learned about customer service, sales, estimating, print production and management, and, of course, graphic design. She excels in collaborative relationships with clients and has successfully managed projects from print collateral development to large campaigns. Melodee particularly enjoys the organization and detail required for high-end photography/art books, catalogs, and magazines.

When Melodee isn't working, she can be found hiking, reading, cooking, and entertaining friends and family. She lives with her husband Mark and two adorable dogs in Elverson, PA.
