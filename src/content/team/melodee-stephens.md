Melodee’s love of design and print started at 15 East Lancaster Avenue: her father’s printing shop. (Get it? 15 East!) She watched him form meaningful relationships with his customers and to serve them well with creativity, integrity, and insight. She loved everything about it. So much so that she went on to study graphc design. 25 years later, she’s still learning and studying, pouring over the kern in every line and completing perfect files for production. She loves how design marries precision and art. Her favorite projects are ones where she gets to be part of a collaborative team, and if it involves a complicated book project, all the&nbsp;better.

She loves to hike, read, cook, and entertain her friends and family at her home in Elverson, PA. She lives with her husband Mark and two (very adorable)&nbsp;dogs.
