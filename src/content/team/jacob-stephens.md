Part web developer, part project manager, wholly nerd. Jacob’s role at 15 East is technical: the man is all about data and detail. He takes beautiful design and makes it live and breathe on the web. He keeps large projects moving through our design&nbsp;process.

Unsurprisingly, Jacob uses his technical mind in the off hours. He is fond of strategic board games and would be glad for you to join him in a game of Tigris & Euphrates. He lives in Lancaster, PA with his wife Kendel Lyn. Don’t be surprised if he comes to a meeting with three game&nbsp;options.
