oliviaQuote: "In my 25 years in marketing and communications, Melodee is hands down the all-around strongest designer with which I’ve ever had the pleasure of partnering. Not only does she have inspiring creative chops, she is detail-oriented, incredibly responsive, and has never missed a deadline in the six years we have worked together. She also brings to the table extensive print production knowledge and resources to support her clients from conception to&nbsp;delivery."
