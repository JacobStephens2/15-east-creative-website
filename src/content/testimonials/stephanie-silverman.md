Melodee elevated our marketing materials from simply satisfactory to 'wow'-and with the first issue of our newly redesigned Alumni magazine, **we were recognized with a First Place Award in the design category by the Delaware Scholastic Press Association (2020). We also saw an uptick in annual giving as a direct result.** In an increasingly competitive and saturated admissions market, independent schools in particular must clearly articulate their brand and mission to prospective families. Melodee's design will accomplish just&nbsp;that.
