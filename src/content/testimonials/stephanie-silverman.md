Melodee is an absolutely phenomenal designer. She is a careful listener, creative and imaginative thinker, and incredibly responsive. Melodee successfully translated the essence of our school's core mission and identity into refreshed, contemporary, engaging and on-brand visual stories and design pieces. Sensitive to the many priorities and fast pace of the non-profit sector (and private independent school world in particular), Melodee's services also included her role as a liaison to our printer to communicate all of the granular detail specifications that may otherwise slip. Her in-depth knowledge of printing and design alleviate the pressure on busy marketing teams and to help keep the focus squarely on efficient use of time to streamline both process and&nbsp;production.

Melodee elevated our marketing materials from simply satisfactory to 'wow'-and with the first issue of our newly redesigned Alumni magazine, **we were recognized with a First Place Award in the design category by the Delaware Scholastic Press Association (2020). We also saw an uptick in annual giving as a direct result.** In an increasingly competitive and saturated admissions market, independent schools in particular must clearly articulate their brand and mission to prospective families. Melodee's design will accomplish just&nbsp;that.
