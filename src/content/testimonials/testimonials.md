With nothing more than a nascent brand deck, she used the guidelines as a starting point and worked alongside us to co-create a visual identity that clearly differentiated our school amidst a competitive landscape. Our new brand, in every design expression, set us apart as a joyful and rigorous learning institution. Melodee’s willingness to dive into a project — regardless of the timeline — made her an indispensable member of our small marketing and communications team. Melodee’sclassic aesthetic, combined with her astute attention to fine detail, makes her a true creative force who produces inspiring work.",

Not only does she have inspiring creative chops, she is detail-oriented, incredibly responsive, and has never missed a deadline in the six years we have worked together. She also brings to the table extensive print production knowledge and resources to support her clients from conception to&nbsp;delivery."
