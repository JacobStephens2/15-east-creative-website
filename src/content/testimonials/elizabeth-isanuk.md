Working with Melodee is a true pleasure! When I stepped into my role of Director of Marketing & Communications (a department of one) for a Preschool - Grade 8 Independent School, and inherited the working relationship with Melodee, I quickly realized what an asset Melodee was to our School and felt so fortunate to have her in my corner. 

With her creative and precise talents, Melodee is expertly able to both turn my vision into reality, or help me develop my vision in the first place. I trust her to help with the ideation of projects and with the iteration of projects - she often provides multiple design options without me even&nbsp;asking.
