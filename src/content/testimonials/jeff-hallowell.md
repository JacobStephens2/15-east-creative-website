I hired Melodee as a freelance designer in July of 2016 after seeing some of her work.  Sometimes I would take a picture of a sketch on a napkin.  I would include a small description of what it should be and Melodee will convert that concept into an image that communicates to a wide audience.  She has been able to help me bridge our technical work into concepts that can be understood by a wide audience. I would highly recommend Melodee as a professional that can deliver high quality&nbsp;content.
