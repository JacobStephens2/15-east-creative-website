My task was to publish a book commemorating our institutionâ€™s 160th anniversary. Melodee Stephens took my text and 600 plus images and transformed them into an exquisite keepsake volume of over 250 pages. Her experience in the print industry and her creative design talents are top shelf. She guided me, a novice, through the entire design and print process with wise advice and professional insight. Her attention to detail and her ability to capture brand are assets to her clients. The finished book received accolades from our constituents. And I so enjoyed working with Melodee, I have engaged her services for alumni&nbsp;communications.
