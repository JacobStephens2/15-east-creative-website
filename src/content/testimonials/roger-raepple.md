I am very appreciative of what Melodee did for me. Most importantly in the design Melodee reflected exactly what I wanted â€“ respectful, understated, somber, simple. What Melodee has done to improve the book over what I anticipated is stunning. I had no idea that a talented designer could provide such a positive&nbsp;impact.
