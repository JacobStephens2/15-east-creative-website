I have worked with Melodee for several years for a variety of my design needs.  I have worked with other designers in the past, but Melodee's work is extraordinary.  She has a true gift for design - she listens to my needs, interprets it to the market and delivers results that I have always been pleased with.  She is very talented, professional, timely and very reasonable.  I highly recommend her - definitely 5&nbsp;stars!
