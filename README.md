# 15 East Creative's Website

The site can be viewed at [15eastcreative.com](https://15eastcreative.com).

I started this site from [Zerostatic's](https://www.zerostatic.io/) Gatsby starter, [Gatsby Serif Theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/gatsby-serif-theme). You can see their [demo of this starter here](https://gatsby-serif.netlify.app/).

This site was originally developed with React and Gatsby, and it was hosted on Gatsby Cloud, but at the ending of Gatsby Cloud its hosting was moved to a php server.
